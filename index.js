// Note: We'll be using the Fahrenheit scale for this assignment!

// This code sets a random starting current temperature between 0 and 100 degrees
let currentTemp = Math.round(Math.random() * 100)

// Give the user of the thermostat a status message
console.log(`The current temperature is ${currentTemp}Â°F`)
